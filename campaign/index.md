## Characters

The following general rules apply to building your characters:

* Starting point value is 150
  * No more than 75 points in disadvantages
  * Up to 5 perks
  * Up to 5 quirks
  * Up to 15 points may be used as a "down payment" toward a more expensive trait to be purchased later with awarded points
* Campaign tech level (TL) is 4
  * Character TL may be lowered to 2 or raised (with approval, and caveats) to 5
  * Starting wealth (at TL4) is $2000 (average level) and may be lowered to $400 (poor level) or raised to $4000 (comfortable level)
  * Ordinary TL0 – TL4 equipment from _GURPS Basic Set_ and _GURPS Low-Tech_ is available
  * Amazing equipment from _GURPS Fantasy-Tech 1—The Edge of Reality_ might be available with GM approval (and potential adjustments)
* Starting status level is 0 and may be lowered to -1 or raised to 1
* Characters may have up to 2 levels of rank (with approval)
* Advantages, perks, disadvantages, and quirks
  * All mental, physical, social, and mundane ones are available except for those that wouldn't make sense for a "normal" human or conflict with the setting (e.g. depend on a higher TL)
  * All exotic and supernatural ones are unavailable unless explicitly allowed
    * Available exoctic/supernatural advantages
      * Blessed or Heroic Feats
      * Destiny<sup>†</sup> (but be wary)
      * Higher Purpose
      * Power Investiture 1 (with an appropriate deity)
      * True Faith (with an appropriate deity)
    * Available exoctic/supernatural disadvantages
      * Destiny<sup>†</sup> (but be wary)
      * Divine Curse<sup>†</sup>
      * Dread<sup>†</sup> (with appropriate subject)
      * Magic Susceptibility 1
      * Revulsion<sup>†</sup> (with appropriate subject)
    * _Others might be available with a good story and_ Unusual Background [10] _to support it_
  * Most modifiers and limitations don't make sense, but some limitations could be used to justify an otherwise unavailable advantage/disadvantage
  * [Racial templates](../templates/races/) supersede these restrictions
* All regular (non-cinematic) skills are available if appropriate for the character's TL
