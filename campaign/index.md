_Nestled in the shadow of the mountain from which it gets its name, the peaceful and prosperous kingdom of [Taki](../places/taki) lies at the cusp of a cataclysm that will change the world of Kom forever._


## Books

The campaign uses the following books:

* [GURPS Basic Set](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/) (may start with simplified rules in [GURPS Lite](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/) or [GURPS Ultra-Lite](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/ultra-lite/))
* [GURPS Low Tech](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech/) plus [Low-Tech Companion 1: Philosophers and Kings](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech/companion1/), [Low-Tech Companion 2: Weapons and Warriors](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech/companion2/), [Low-Tech Companion 3: Daily Life and Economics](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech/companion3/), [GURPS Low-Tech: Instant Armor](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/instantarmor/), and [GURPS Loadouts: Low-Tech Armor](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/loadouts/lowtecharmor/)
* [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/) and [GURPS Underground Adventures](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/undergroundadventures/)
* [GURPS Fantasy-Tech 1: The Edge of Reality](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/fantasy-tech/fantasy-tech1/) (on a case-by-case basis)
* Other books, especially those concerning magic and advanced combat, will be added later

Where conflicts exist, rules from more specialized books take precedence over general books.


## Characters

The following general rules apply to building your characters:

* Starting point value is 150
  * No more than 75 points in disadvantages
  * Up to 5 perks
  * Up to 5 quirks
  * Up to 15 points may be used as a "down payment" toward a more expensive trait to be purchased later with awarded points
* Campaign tech level (TL) is 4
  * Character TL may be lowered to 2 or raised (with approval, and caveats) to 5
  * Starting wealth (at TL4) is $2000 (average level) and may be lowered to $400 (poor level) or raised to $4000 (comfortable level)
  * Ordinary TL0 – TL4 equipment is available
  * Advanced equipment might be available with GM approval (and potential adjustments)
* Starting status level is 0 and may be lowered to -1 or raised to 1
* Characters may have up to 2 levels of rank (with approval)
* Advantages, perks, disadvantages, and quirks
  * All mental, physical, social, and mundane ones are available except for those that wouldn't make sense for a "normal" human or conflict with the setting (e.g. depend on a higher TL)
  * All exotic and supernatural ones are unavailable unless explicitly allowed
    * Available exoctic/supernatural advantages
      * Blessed or Heroic Feats
      * Destiny<sup>†</sup> (but be wary)
      * Higher Purpose
      * Power Investiture 1 (with an appropriate deity)
      * True Faith (with an appropriate deity)
    * Available exoctic/supernatural disadvantages
      * Destiny<sup>†</sup> (but be wary)
      * Divine Curse<sup>†</sup>
      * Dread<sup>†</sup> (with appropriate subject)
      * Magic Susceptibility 1
      * Revulsion<sup>†</sup> (with appropriate subject)
    * _Others might be available with a good story and_ Unusual Background [10] _to support it_
  * Most modifiers and limitations don't make sense, but some limitations could be used to justify an otherwise unavailable advantage/disadvantage
  * [Racial templates](../templates/races/) supersede these restrictions
* All regular (non-cinematic) skills are available if appropriate for the character's TL

### Skills

When allocating points to skills, keep in mind that the skills of an average person, who does average things in their average life, are usually between 8 and 13 (8 or 9 for ones learned during their youth but rarely used and 12 or 13 for ones used daily doing their job).  By contrast, the skills of an expert (or, at least, the ones they're experts in) are between 14 and 19, with a 16 being enough to virtually guarantee success under typical circumstances (since a roll of 17 or 18 is an automatic failure).  Adventurers can't be experts in everything, but they're likely to be experts in some things, their "signature" skills.  For everything else, a few points here and there will help round them out and they can fall back on defaults for the rest (if allowed for the skills in question).

#### "Everyman" Skills

While not required, being competent in "everyman" skills makes characters more believable adventurers (and helps keep the story flowing).  With high ability scores, defaults could be enough.  But it's generally recommended that every character have some basic training (i.e. spend at least 1 point) in each of the following areas:

* Carousing, Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, _or_ Interrogation
* Climbing, Hiking, _and_ Stealth
* Driving _or_ Riding
* First Aid
* Gesture
* Observation, Scrounging, _or_ Search
* Savoir-Faire or Streetwise
* Axe/Mace, Broadsword, Knife, Shortsword, _or_ Staff
* Bow, Crossbow, _or_ Guns
* Boxing, Brawling, _or_ Karate
* Forced Entry
* Holdout
* Judo, Sumo Wrestling, _or_ Wrestling
* Throwing

### Niches

The party (4 &ndash; 6 characters) should have at least:

* Two characters that are well-trained in combat
* One character with solid medical ability
* One character that's comfortable in the outdoors
* One character who's skilled at getting in and out of places
* One character with access to "hidden" knowledge

Additionally, as it is outlawed in [Tarrsia](../places/tarrsia/), no more than one character may be built with magic as his central theme.  With permission (see above), other characters could have trace levels of magic.
