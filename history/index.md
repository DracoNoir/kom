## The Ages of Kom

The following describes, in brief, the ages that the world of Kom has seen.

### The Age Before Ages

"In the beginning there was Sypaetyrnyumenius; and everything was one."  Thus begins the Lore of the Dragon Lords and the dawn of the First Age.  But before the Dragon Lords were born, and before time was even measured in Ages, the first gods appeared and formed the world.  The first of these gods were Goeteph, the Allfather, and K'Bal, the Deceiver.  Together they created the gods of the primordial elements, Athea, Lutan, Zytar, Opeia, and Khaotel.  Finally, Goeteph created T'ere, the Soulforger.

### The First Age

The First Age began with the creation of the Dragon Lords.  Following this, many new races were born and they grew to fill the lands and air.  Among these were the fey.  Playful and fun-loving, the fey resented to oppressive rulership of the Dragon Lords.  Eventually they banded together with the reclusive giants and drove the Dragon Lords from Kom.  This age also saw the appearance of the gods Kyurta, Khada, and Dagahr, the cleaving of T'ere into the twin gods Aetere and Nekere, and the formation of the triple gods Syr Chin, Syr Tyn, and Syr Pa.

### The Second Age

The Second Age began with the departure of the Dragon Lords and the appearance of the gods Kel, Enkana, and Pidex.  Known as the Time of Peace, the races of Kom grew and flourished.  However, towards the end many races became ambitious and sought to dominate the world.  Among these were the Necroteece, a powerful humanoid race dedicated to the worship of Nekere.  Using their strength, they conquered the lands and began the Third Age.

### The Third Age

The Third Age began with the ascent of the Necroteece.  Talented and driven, the Necroteece revolutionized the world by introducing the science of magic.  But their subjects were upset that a race created by Aetere was dedicated to the service of Nekere and conspired to reclaim Kom in the name of Aetere.  So they stole some of their masters' secrets and used it to strike the Necroteece from the world.  Resentful of this uprising, and bitter from seeing their loss of power, the last of the Necroteece destroyed most of their secrets before they themselves were destroyed.

### The Fourth Age

The Fourth Age began with the destruction of the Necroteece empire and the worldâ€™s plunge into a dark age.  Over time, humanity began to relearn some of the secrets that were lost in the last age.  Eventually, they used this knowledge to bring order and prosperity to the world.

### The Fifth Age

Prophesy says that a Fifth Age will begin with the return of a lost race and the end of the wars between Aetere and Nekere.
