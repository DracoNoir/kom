## The Ages of Kom

The following describes, in brief, the ages that the world of Kom has seen.

### The Age Before Ages

"In the beginning there was [Sypaetyrnyumenius](../deities/sypaetyrnyumenius); and everything was one."  Thus begins the Lore of the Dragon Lords and the dawn of the First Age.  But before the Dragon Lords were born, and before time was even measured in Ages, the first gods appeared and formed the world.  The first of these gods were [Goeteph, the Allfather](../deities/goeteph), and [K'Bal, the Deceiver](../deities/kbal).  Together they created the gods of the primordial elements, [Athea](../deities/athea) and [Opeia](../deities/opeia) and, as some believe, [Khaotel](../deities/khaotel), and these gods created [Lutan](../deities/lutan) and [Zytar](../deities/zytar).  Finally, [Goeteph](../deities/goeteph) created [T'ere, the Soulforger](../deities/tere).

### The First Age

The First Age began with [T'ere](../deities/tere) creating the Dragon Lords.  Following this, many new races were born and they grew to fill the lands and air.  Among these were the fey.  Playful and fun-loving, the fey resented to oppressive rulership of the Dragon Lords.  Eventually they banded together with the reclusive giants and drove the Dragon Lords from Kom.  This age also saw the appearance of the gods [Kyurta](../deities/kyurta), [Khada](../deities/khada), and [Dagahr](../deities/dagahr), the cleaving of [T'ere](../deities/tere) into the twin gods [Aetere](../deities/aetere) and [Nekere](../deities/nekere), and the formation of the triple gods [Syr Chin](../deities/syrchin), [Syr Tyn](../deities/syrtyn), and [Syr Pa](../deities/syrpa).

### The Second Age

The Second Age began with the departure of the Dragon Lords and the appearance of the gods [Kel](../deities/kel), [Enkana](../deities/enkana), and [Pidex](../deities/pidex).  Known as the Time of Peace, the races of Kom grew and flourished.  However, towards the end many races became ambitious and sought to dominate the world.  Among these were the Necroteece, a powerful humanoid race dedicated to the worship of [Nekere](../deities/nekere).  Using their strength, they conquered the lands and began the Third Age.

### The Third Age

The Third Age began with the ascent of the Necroteece.  Talented and driven, the Necroteece revolutionized the world by introducing the science of magic.  But their subjects were upset that a race created by [Aetere](../deities/aetere) was dedicated to the service of [Nekere](../deities/nekere) and conspired to reclaim Kom in the name of [Aetere](../deities/aetere).  So they stole some of their masters' secrets and used it to strike the Necroteece from the world.  Resentful of this uprising, and bitter from seeing their loss of power, the last of the Necroteece destroyed most of their secrets before they themselves were destroyed.

### The Fourth Age

The Fourth Age began with the destruction of the Necroteece empire and the worldâ€™s plunge into a dark age.  Over time, humanity began to relearn some of the secrets that were lost in the last age.  Eventually, they used this knowledge to bring order and prosperity to the world.

### The Fifth Age

Prophesy says that a Fifth Age will begin with the return of a lost race and the end of the wars between [Aetere](../deities/aetere) and [Nekere](../deities/nekere).
