Templates can be used to construct characters with a smaller set of building blocks than what's provided by the full _GURPS Basic Set_ rules.  While not entirely prescriptive—characters may be created fully from scratch—these templates are indicative of the types of characters expected to exist in Kom and, more importantly, succeed within the campaign.  Furthermore, some of these templates (the racial ones) include abilities not otherwise available to from-scratch characters.
