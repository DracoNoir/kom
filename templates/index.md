Templates can be used to construct characters with a smaller set of building blocks than what's provided by the full _GURPS Basic Set_ rules.  While not entirely prescriptive—characters may be created fully from scratch—these templates are indicative of the types of characters expected to exist in Kom and, more importantly, succeed within the campaign.  Furthermore, some of these templates (the racial ones) include abilities not otherwise available to from-scratch characters.

## Optimizations

All templates are designed to be as optimal as possible.  However, when building a character from multiple templates, additional optimizations may be possible and players should take advantage of them to gain additional points to spend (or better traits).  For example,

* A template with three DX/Average skills at DX+2 will spend 24 points on them.  Combining this with another template with three other DX/Average skills at DX+2 will spend another 24 points on them, for a total of 48 points on the six skills.  However, the same skill levels can be reached more cheaply by spending only 24 to make them DX+1 and another 20 points on +1 to DX, improving all DX skills (!) and freeing up 4 points to be spent on something else.
* A template with a DX/Average skill at DX+2 will spend 8 points on it.  Combining this with another template with the same skill at DX+2 would spend another 8 points on it—for a total of 16 points to reach DX+4.  The player may instead choose to keep the skill at DX+2 (honoring the design of both templates) and spend the "extra" 8 points elsewhere.
