## Archer
<points>75 points</points>

> This template works for any light missile troops who provide support to cavalry or heavier infantry.  The longbow is the classic weapon, but other options are available.

## Artificer
<points>75 points</points>

> Artificers are the technology specialists of fantasy worlds.  They can't use spells or other forms of magic, but they can make devices that seem equally wonderful and mysterious to the untrained, such as singing birds made from gold, temple doors that open by themselves, or Greek fire.

## Assassin
<points>125 points</points>

> Assassins kill people for impersonal reasons, in service to a cause or because someone paid them.  Fantasy literature often describes assassins' guilds selling their services to the highest bidder, no questions asked.  This template is for a professional assassin, whether a loyal guild member or a freelancer.

## Bandit
<points>75 points</points>

> Of all outlaws, bandits and highwaymen attract the most hero worship.  Anywhere the common people resent the rulers, a bandit may be seen as a defender of the poor, like Robin Hood.  In a conquered province, the old aristocrats may actually become bandits; in any society, the bandit's weapons—and often horses—makes him look like an aristocrat.  Cinematic heroes such as Zorro may deliberately assume the role of bandits for noble motives.  Real bandits are usually less noble, even if they take advantage of the heroic image.  This template defines an outlaw who really is honorable, relying on stealth and concealment rather than overwhelming force in his struggle against the ruling class.

## Barbarian
<points>75 points</points>

> The half-naked warrior from a primitive land is a stereotype in heroic fantasy.  This version is a midpoint between actual tribal peoples and mighty-thewed pulp or cinematic heroes.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 116 – 117


## Bard
<points>75 points</points>

> Bards range from wandering minstrels who perform in taverns to divinely inspired singers in royal courts or great temples. Legend and fantasy often show them as specially privileged. This template can also be used to create combat-ready adventurers who sing and tell tales when the battles are over; for such an adventurer, use most of the unspent points on weapon skills. Light infantry weapons such as bows are traditional for bards.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 117 – 118


## Battle Wizard
<points>125 points</points>

> A rare breed.  Battle wizards can master the intellectual intricacies of magic, but also keep alive—and concentrate on casting spells—amid the chaos of a battle.  Having a high enough skill level to reduce the energy cost of spells has a big payoff for them; high IQ and Magery give them this ability with all Hard spells.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 118 – 119


## Caver
<points>75 points</points>

> Some people go underground for fun.  Traditionally, they're called spelunkers; many now prefer the name ‘cavers.'  Serious enthusiasts have long believed in preserving the underground environment; standards are now more rigorous.

— [GURPS Underground Adventures](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/undergroundadventures/), page 15


## Chthonomancer
<points>125 points</points>

> Some wizards specialize in going underground, whether as adventurers or as workers.  Many spells are useful for underground activities, including several specifically developed for such environments (Spells, pp. 22-23).

— [GURPS Underground Adventures](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/undergroundadventures/), pages 15 – 16


## Enchanter
<points>125 points</points>

> The enchanter specializes in creating magical objects.  The wizard is more often an Ally or Patron for adventurers than a member of the party.  He may travel in search of rare magical materials or information, but might also recruit other people for such jobs.  On the other hand, his knowledge of a wide range of commonly used spells can make him unexpectedly formidable.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), page 119


## Geologist
<points>75 points</points>

> From ancient Greek natural historians to high-tech 21st century scientists, people studying the earth often go out into the field.  The geologist has basic survival and technical skills and mastery of the scientific knowledge of his age.

— [GURPS Underground Adventures](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/undergroundadventures/), page 16


## Gladiator
<points>125 points</points>

> As much an entertainer as a warrior, you earn your living by risking death in the arena.  Most gladiators are slaves, which limits their options as adventurers... but free men sometimes fight in the arena, for money or to show off their courage and skill, and slaves may buy their freedom after successful careers.  This template represents a former gladiator whose skills haven't yet faded.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 215 – 216


## Hedge Wizard
<points>75 points</points>

> Not every wizard is a mighty wonder-worker or an intellectual giant.  In a magical setting, some mages are only talented enough to learn a few basic spells.  Some specializations require specific advantages; for example, a healer needs either Empathy or Magery 1.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 119 – 120


## Holy Man
<points>75 points</points>

> The holy man isn't necessarily an ordained priest; the gods make their own choices of who they should favor.  The mark of the holy man is his possession of supernatural powers and his ability to inspire others to worship his god.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 120 – 121


## Investigator
<points>100 points</points>

> You are a detective, investigative reporter, occult investigator, spy, or thief.

— [GURPS Basic Set](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/), page 259 – 260


## Knight
<points>75 points</points>

> A knight is an aristocratic warrior, able to afford the costliest battle gear and the time to practice its use.  The standard medieval version is a heavy cavalryman.  This template defines a heroic knight who actually lives by the chivalric standards of honor.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), page 121


## Legionary
<points>125 points</points>

> The legions are [Tarrsia]'s heavy infantry; [Tarrsian] strategy and tactics rely primarily on their skills.  Legionaries rigorously train for military duties, but also serve in administrative and law enforcement roles; most have craft skills as well.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), page 216


## Lurker
<points>125 points</points>

> In a world with extensive underground settlements, or haunted underground ruins, some people may specialize in ventures beneath the surface. They may be freelance treasure seekers, or hire out to larger organizations as guides or spies.

— [GURPS Underground Adventures](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/undergroundadventures/), pages 16 – 17


## Merchant
<points>75 points</points>

> Merchants come in many varieties.  This template fits somewhere in between the fast-talking man at a little stall in the marketplace and the merchant prince whose house is a castle in all but name.  This merchant is rich enough to engage in long-distance trade, but not rich enough to hire other people to journey for him—the kind most likely to have adventures, or to create them for other people.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 121 – 122


## Peasant Adventurer
<points>75 points</points>

> Not content with life on the farm, you've left home to look for a more interesting life.  Better pay wouldn't hurt, but money's not your main motivation; you never seem to stay ahead despite occasional windfalls.  You aren't an outright bandit or rebel, though you may think you're as good a man as any aristocrat.  You remain a simple soul, with the virtues and vices of common men—on a bigger scale than usual.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 122 – 123


## Scholar
<points>75 points</points>

> Scholars most often appear as NPCs, giving cryptic advice to bands of adventurers who come to consult them.  But nothing prevents a scholar from picking up a few combat skills and going out to find his own answers.  This template provides a start in that direction by including a few less sedate skills picked up during the scholar's student days.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), page 123


## Soldier of Fortune
<points>100 points</points>

> You're a warrior.  You could be a soldier, pirate, knight-errant, gunslinger, street fighter, or guerrilla.

— GURPS Basic Set, page 260


## Sorcerer
<points>125 points</points>

> This template describes a sorcerer who has learned his art through his own investigations.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), page 218


## Spellcaster
<points>75 points</points>

> This intermediate-level mage is not as limited as the hedge wizard, but lacks the extraordinary gifts of the battle wizard or enchanter.  He has enough combat skills to give him a chance of surviving a melee, but his main specialty is some category of useful spells.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), page 124


## Surgeon
<points>125 points</points>

> Having limited access to healing magic, [Tarrsians] often must turn to surgeons for treatment of injuries.  Many surgeons first learn their craft in the army, and this template assumes some military experience.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), page 219


## Thief
<points>75 points</points>

> Thieves live by taking other people's property, not by force of arms but by stealth.  If the thief has to fight, the job has already gone wrong.  This template emphasizes stealth and concealment.  Potential victims may provide safeguards for their valuables, so thieves also have some knowledge of getting past walls, locks, and traps.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 124 – 125


## Village Sage
<points>75 points</points>

> You may be your small community's priest, healer, or soothsayer, or you may have just lived a long time and seen a lot.  Your native intelligence has grown into sound judgment; even people who think you're ‘unworldly' seek out your advice.  Village sages are usually middle-aged or older, but this isn't a requirement; some young people are wise.

— [GURPS Fantasy](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Fantasy/), pages 125 – 126


## Wardancer
<points>75 points</points>

> Wardancers are an analog of Asian martial artists in the style of more traditional fantasy: specialists in lightly armed or unarmed hand-to-hand combat, relying on speed and coordination more than strength.  They could be found in cultures modeled on the Near East, or among elves, or in any other culture that needs an exotic flavor.  Their official role is as performers and entertainers, but their combat skills are real.
