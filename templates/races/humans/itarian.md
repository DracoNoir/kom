Itarians are the dominate race in Kom and are thought to be the closest to the original human race.  Unless another template is chosen, a character is an Itarian.

Itarians are the most diverse-looking of the human races.  Primary skin colors include white-pink, yellow, and brownâ€”red only occurs when sunburned (including chronically).  Primary hair colors include ginger, blonde, brown, and black; head and (in men) facial hair in elderly individuals often turns silver/grey or (sometimes) white and (mostly in men) head hair sometimes becomes thinner or develops some degree of baldness.  Head hair is usually straight or wavy, but can also form into loose curls.  Secondary skin and hair colors include blendings of primary ones (e.g. olive skin and auburn hair).  Some individuals have multicolored hair (e.g. speckled brown and red head hair) and most have slightly differently colored/toned head, limb, pubic, and (in men) facial hair.  In most cases, hair tone is darker than skin tone.  Eye colors include amber, blue, green, and brown.  Individuals with northern ancestry usually have lighter colors/tones while individuals with southern ancestry usually have darker colors/tones, but exceptions do occur.

Itarians can be slight or stocky, short or tall, or anywhere in between.
