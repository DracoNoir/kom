At the end of the Second Age, after being cleaved from [T'ere](../../../deities/tere), [Aetere](../../../deities/aetere) created the Human race.  Originally a homogenous race, over the ages humanity evolved into five (known) distinct sub-races.  To this day they remain biologically compatible, but, with the exception of the lingering [Dragonkin](#dragonkin) and [Necroteece](#necroteece) bloodlines, only one kind breeds true in any human offspring.

## Bloodlines

In addition to being one of the modern races, some humans are descended from an extinct race and still exhibit some of their ancient traits.  Players may select one bloodline lens to apply to a character.

### Dragonkin
<points>+15</points>

Although the Dragon Lords have long since departed Kom, while they were here they often dallied with mortals and some of their progeny still remain.

As a descendent of a Dragon Lord, select from one of the following bloodlines:

* _Dragon Blood:_  Cold-Blooded [-5]; pick one of,
  * Regeneration (Regular) [25]; Unusual Biochemistry [-5]
  * Regrowth (Minor) [20]
* _Dragon Eye:_  Nictitating Membrane 1 [1]; Distinctive Feature (Reptilian Eyes) [-1]; pick one of,
  * Dark Vision [25]; Colorblindness [-10]
  * Infravision [10]; Protected Sense (Vision) [5]
  * Microscopic Vision 2 [10]; Protected Sense (Vision) [5]
  * Protected Sense (Vision) [5]; Telescopic Vision 2 [10]
  * Protected Sense (Vision) [5]; Ultravision [10]
* _Dragon Hand:_  Acute Touch 1 [2]; Claws (Blunt) [3]; Sensitive Touch [10]

* _Dragon Tongue:_  Penetrating Voice [1]; Protected Sense (Hearing) [5]; Distinctive Feature (Forked Tongue) [-1]; pick one of,
  * Subsonic Speech [10]
  * Ultrasonic Speech [10]

In addition to the bloodline-specific traits, all Dragonkin have both _Social Regard (Dragonkin) [5]_ and _Social Stigma (Half-breed) [-5]_, representing society's conflicting attitudes towards these half-breeds.  Unless indicated otherwise, roll 1d to determine a character's viewpoint once the bloodline is recognized:  on a 1 or 2 the viewpoint is positive, on a 3 or 4 the viewpoint is neutral, and on a 5 or 6 the viewpoint is negative.

### Necroteece
<points>+15</points>

Millennia ago, a group of humans sought a way to bring themselves closer to [Nekere](../../../deities/nekere), the goddess they worshipped.  After decades of experimenting with strong magics and selective breeding, a new breed of human was born.  Dubbed the Necroteece, this breed retained many of the traits of its human ancestors while gaining those of the creatures of [Nekere](../../../deities/nekere).  More mentally adept than their human cousins, the Necroteece had a natural understanding of the nature of magic and excelled at all of the magical arts.

As a descendent of a Necroteece, select from one of the following bloodlines:

* _Channeller:_  Magery 1 [15]; Magic Resistance 1, Improved [5]
* _Detector:_  pick one of,
  * Detect (Magic; Precise) [20]
  * Detect (Life; Vague) [15]; Detect (Undead; Vague) [5]
  * Psychometry [20]
* _Invader:_  Empathy (Sensitive) [5]; pick one of,
  * Medium [10]; Spirit Empathy [10]; Phantom Voices (Annoying) [-5]
  * Mind Probe (Costs Fatigue 1, Unreliable 11) [15]
  * Mind Reading [30]; Supersensitive [-15]

In addition to the bloodline-specific traits, all Necroteece have _Social Stigma (Necroteece) [-5]_, representing society's hatred of their ancestors.  The descendants of the Necroteece also have _Social Regard (Necroteece)_ granting +1 reaction bonus from all other Necroteece, but this is worth 0 points due to the rarity of appearance.
