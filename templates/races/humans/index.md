At the end of the Second Age, after being cleaved from T'ere, Aetere created the Human race.  Originally a homogenous race, over the ages humanity evolved into five (known) distinct sub-races.  To this day they remain biologically compatible, but, with the exception of the lingering [Necroteece](#necroteece) and [Dragonkin](#dragonkin) bloodlines, only one kind breeds true in any human offspring.

[Itarian](itarian)
