<points>30</points>

As the power of the Necroteece grew in the Third Age, so too did their use of magic and their discovery of technologies.  Viewing these advancements as unnatural, a group of humans, followers of [Kyurta](../../../deities/kyurta) and [Khada](../../../deities/khada), broke from society and migrated to the wildernesses in an effort to return to the ways of nature before the appearance of the Dragon Lords.  Eschewing all but the most basic technologies, eventually these people evolved into their own race, the Xentei.

The appearance of Xentei depends on which god of nature they are most closely aligned with.
