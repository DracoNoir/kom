As the human races covered the land, some, seeking the wisdom and strength of Athea, climbed the mountains and found homes deep within them.  Over time, they adapted to their environment, living in tight quarters without natural light, and evolved into the race known as the Athenite.

After generations of living mostly underground, Athenites developed a dominant form of genetic albinism.  All Athenites have pale-pink skin, pink-white hair (limb, pubic, and head), and ice-blue eyes.  All Athenites have limb, pubic, and head hair but never facial hairâ€”baldness (except from shaving) does not occur.  Head hear is always straight.

Athenites have small frames and tend to be slight and short.

## Customization Notes

Many Athenites have one or two levels of the _Reduced Consumption_ advantage due to adapting to living in areas with less available food.  Most Athenites who were raised entirely underground have the _Hunchback [-10]_ disadvantage due to living in such close quarters.

The _Skinny [-5]_ and _Dwarfism [-15]_ traits are available.  Other build traits are extremely rare and require GM approval.
