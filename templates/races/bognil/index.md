No one knows how they came to be, but the Bognil appeared during the Third Age, emerging from the mountains north of the Delusian Province.

The Bognil have a complex society that is composed of young, undifferentiated bognil and several specialized "breeds" of adult bognil.  Each adult type fills a particular role in society.

Young bognil are called [boh bognil](boh) and each possess the same basic characteristics.  Upon reaching maturity, a [boh bognil](boh) may take part in a sacred ceremony where his life path is chosen by the consumption of a special concoction which causes a metamorphosis to occur.  Once the process is complete, the bognil will transform into one of the differentiated breeds.

Bognil villages are usually found in secluded, arid mountainous regions.  Private by nature, bognil's prefer these lands both for their isolation and because it is the only places the special herbs are found which are used for their maturation process.
