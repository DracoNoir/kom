All bognil are born bohâ€”the bognil word for youth.  During their first decade they are truly children, growing and learning like any other species does.  However, upon reaching physical maturity (at about 10 years old) they begin a journey to find their true destiny.   After their 20th birthday, bognil who are ready participate in a ceremony that transforms them into their true bognil form.  Those who are not ready continue their journey as a boh.  Some are never ready.

When (and if) a character is ready to metamorphosize, pay the point difference for the new template and swap all affected traits.  Certain traits (with GM approval) may be bought over time, representing a gradual adaptation.
