At the beginning of the second age, [Khada](../../../deities/khada) looked down upon his creations and was pleased at how they had flourished.  Seeking perfection, he called out for the mightiest of the predators to come and compete to determine who was the strongest and fastest among them.  To the victor, he proclaimed, would go the greatest of gifts, the title of Champion of Khada.  After completing many challenges, one creature was found to be the best, [Thuma](../../../deities/thuma) the tigress.  So, as he had promised, [Khada](../../../deities/khada) came upon [Thuma](../../../deities/thuma), took her paw, and decreed before all of his creatures that [Thuma](../../../deities/thuma) would be his champion and would serve him in the Great Wilderness.  And so he took [Thuma](../../../deities/thuma) and infused her with divinity so that she may continue as his champion for all time.

Proud of her feline heritage, [Thuma](../../../deities/thuma) desired to reward the best of her kind as Khada had rewarded her.  Seeing the mighty deeds that the emerging humanoid races could accomplish, she decided to give humanoid form and intellect to cats.  So, [Thuma](../../../deities/thuma) sought out the five greatest prides from among all of the cat races and transformed them into the Thumaren.
