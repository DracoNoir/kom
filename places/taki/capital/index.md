Located in the southeastern corner of [Taki](..), the Capital Discrict is the smallest of [Taki's](..) districts.  But due to a combination of its location and political influence, it's the most powerful and richest district.  It's also the most populous, having more than double the population of any other district.

The bulk of the district is formed by a large valley with an area of nearly 800 square miles.  In the center of that valley, approximately 200 square miles in size, is Lake Taki.  The lake has five major tributaries, one flowing from each of the outlying districts, and it drains southward via the Takian River.  Timber flows continuously from the tributaries into the lake where the wood is gathered and sent to the various mills which dot its shores.  The lake is also a major source of food for the district.  Along the lake's southeastern shore is the [city of Taki](taki), the seat of government for both the district and [Taki](..) itself, and surrounding it and extending to the edges of the valley are scattered farms and numerous small settlements.  [Taki's](..) main trade route runs through the district, entering from the east and exiting to the south, brushing along the markets of [Taki City](taki) along the way.

The senators representing the district are elected to represent each of its major concerns.  One senator is elected by the farmers, fishers, and other citizens responsible for the district's food sources.  One senator is elected by the millers, carpenters, and other citizens who work with wood.  One senator is elected by the members of the trade guilds.  One senator is elected by the members of the merchant guilds.  And one senator is elected by the citizens of the district that are not already represented by another senator.
