Taki is a nation-state within the Tarrsian Empire.  It comprises approximately 8000 square miles of mostly mountainous terrain in the north western quadrant of the Empire.  It lies south of [Mount Venseenai](../venseenai), west of the [T'uanjhaali Wasteland](../wasteland/), and north of [Tarrsia](../tarrsia/).  To its west is a large hybrean forest.

Taki's biggest export is wood grown in its rich mountain soil, primarily in the form of lumber and a unique kind of enriched charcoal.  It also is called home by some of the Empire's preeminant carpenters and woodworkers.  Additionally, Taki features the most accessible trade route between [Tarrsia](../tarrsia/) and the [Wasteland](../wasteland), on which it imposes a small levy.

Taki is divided into six districts.  At its heart is the [Capital District](capital/).  Surrounding the capital, fanning from the eastern border with [T'uanjhaali Wasteland](../wasteland/), along the border with [Mount Venseenai](../venseenai), the western hybrea, and down to the southern boarder with [Tarrsia](../tarrsia/) are its outlying districts of [Tameer](tameer/), [Indez](indez/), [Mindel√©](mindele/), [Rheen](rheen/), and [Pinghee](pinghee/).

As a member of the Empire, Taki is subject to its laws.  But as a nation-state, it has autonomy over most local matters, which it governs in the form of a representative democracy.  Five senators are elected to represent the [capital district](capital/) and five senators are elected to represent Taki's five outlying districts, one from each of them.  This forms a balance of polical power between the capital, which controls the mills and all trade through Taki, and the districts, which are the source of all its wood.  Additionally, a chancellor is nominated by the senate and elected by the citizenry to represent Taki to the Empire and break ties within the senate.
