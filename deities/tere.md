Created by [Goeteph](goeteph), T'ere was the god of creation and life, and was tasked with filling the world with creatures of all kinds.  He first designed the soul, making it the essence of thought and life, and gave it the ability to create more of its own kind.  Then he created the Dragon Lords, in the image of the gods themselves, as the ultimate vessel for the soul.  Soon afterward, he created [Kyurta](kyurta) and [Khada](khada) to create the plants and animals that fill the world while he began to work on other races.  However, [K'Bal](kbal) had tricked [Goeteph](goeteph) into flawing T'ere so that he could not decide what he wanted the other races to be like.  After creating many monstrosities, T'ere broke down and could not create again.  Remorseful for what she had done, [K'Bal](kbal) confessed her treachery to [Goeteph](goeteph) and told him how to correct it.  So [Goeteph](goeteph) took his axe and cleaved T'ere in two, forming the twin gods [Aetere](aetere) and [Nekere](nekere).
