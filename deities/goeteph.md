Created by [Sypaetyrnyumenius](sypaetyrnyumenius), Goeteph was the first god. He was given access to the power that is [Sypaetyrnyumenius](sypaetyrnyumenius) and was tasked with building the world.  Working with his sister [K'Bal](kbal), he created the elemental gods [Athea](athea), [Opeia](opeia), and [Khaotel](khaotel) and directed them to give everything substance abd form.  Later, he created [T'ere](tere) and [Dagahr](dagahr) and, eventually, was compelled to split [T'ere](tere) into the twin gods [Aetere](aetere) and [Nekere](nekere).  Finally, with guidance from [Kâ€™Bal](kbal), he created [Kel](kel), [Pidex](pidex), and [Enkana](enkana).

A benevolent and loving god, Goeteph is only concerned about the welfare and happiness of his children (and their creations).  He is the patron of all those who use their hands and body to work or are otherwise physical in nature.
