Created by [Sypaetyrnyumenius](sypaetyrnyumenius), K'Bal was the first goddess.  She has access to the knowledge that is [Sypaetyrnyumenius](sypaetyrnyumenius) and was tasked with guiding the world.  Working with her brother [Goeteph](goeteph), she created the elemental gods [Athea](athea), [Opeia](opeia), and [Khaotel](khaotel) and directed them to give everything substance and form.  Later, she created the triad [Syr Chin](syrchin), [Syr Tyn](syrtyn), and [Syr Pa](syrpa).  She was also responsible for the flaws of [T'ere](tere), which lead to him losing his mind.  Finally, she guided [Goeteph](goeteph) in the creation of [Kel](kel), [Pidex](pidex), and [Enkana](enkana).

A cunning and manipulative goddess, K'Bal spends much of her time influencing the sentient beings of the world, guiding them to play parts in some kind of grand design.  Of course, no one knows what her real intentions are.  She is the patron of the arts, sciences, and all those who use their mind or are otherwise intellectual in nature.
